\section{Comments}\label{sec:comments}
In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the \url{interactive_comments} option to the shopt builtin is enabled \hyperref[sec:shellbuiltincommands]{(see \textbf{SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS} below)}, a word beginning with \# causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored. An interactive shell without the \url{interactive_comments} option enabled does not allow comments. The \url{interactive_comments} option is on by default in interactive shells.
