\section{Bug Reports}\label{sec:bugreports}
    If you find a bug in bash, you should report it. But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of bash. The latest version is always available from \url{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/bash/}.
    
    Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the bashbug command (from the source package) to submit a bug report. If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well! Suggestions and 'philosophical' bug reports may be mailed to bug-bash@gnu.org or posted to the Usenet newsgroup gnu.bash.bug.
    
    ALL bug reports should include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  The version number of bash
        \item  The hardware and operating system
        \item  The compiler used to compile
        \item  A description of the bug behaviour
        \item  A short script or 'recipe' which exercises the bug
    \end{itemize}
    Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to \url{chet@po.cwru.edu}.
