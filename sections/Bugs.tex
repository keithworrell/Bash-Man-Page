    \begin{itemize}
        \item  It's too big and too slow.
        
        \item  There are some subtle differences between bash and traditional versions of sh, mostly because of the POSIX specification.
    
        \item  Aliases are confusing in some uses.
    
        \item  Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.
    
        \item  Compound commands and command sequences of the form 'a ; b ; c' are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted. When a process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in the sequence. It suffices to place the sequence of commands between parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.
    
        \item  Array variables may not (yet) be exported.
    
        \item  There may be only one active coprocess at a time.
