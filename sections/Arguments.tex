\section{Arguments}\label{sec:arguments}
If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the \textbf{-c} nor the \textbf{-s} option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. If \gls{bash} is invoked in this fashion, \textbf{\$0} is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. \gls{bash} reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. \gls{bash}'s exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in \gls{PATH} for the script.
